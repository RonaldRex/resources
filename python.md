## Learning guide

1. Learn the fundamentals of programming with a course 
that will teach you the basics of computer science.  I recommend reading the book [Starting Out with Python](https://www.amazon.com/Starting-Out-Python-Tony-Gaddis/dp/0133582736)   
and doing all of the exercises at the end of each chapter. Or you can study [Think Python: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython/html/index.html).

2. While you are taking your course you should study 
[The Art and Craft of Programming](http://troll.cs.ua.edu/ACP-PY/index.html). Read the chapters as they correspond to the topics you learn. 

3. When you finish steps 1 and 2 you should move on to 
a more advanced curriculum. Take [MIT's intro to computer science course](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-00sc-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-spring-2011/unit-1/lecture-2-core-elements-of-a-program/).  

4. Learn about other python modules by doing the problems from [Hacker Rank](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/python/py-introduction).
