## Learning guide
1. Get a command of the syntax by doing an interactive tutorial. [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python) or [Learn Python the Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/)
are great for this purpose.  You won't learn problem solving, but it will prepare you for the next
step in your self study.

2. Next, you need to learn the fundamentals of programming and computer science with a structured course.  I recommend reading the book [Starting Out with Python](https://www.amazon.com/Starting-Out-Python-Tony-Gaddis/dp/0133582736) and doing all of the exercises at the end of each chapter. Or you can study [Think Python: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython/html/index.html).  While you are taking your course you should study 
[The Art and Craft of Programming](http://troll.cs.ua.edu/ACP-PY/index.html). Read the chapters as they correspond to the topics you learn. 

3. When you finish steps 1 and 2 you should move on to a more advanced curriculum. Take [MIT's intro to computer science course](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-00sc-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-spring-2011/unit-1/lecture-2-core-elements-of-a-program/).  

4. Learn about other python modules by doing the problems from the [Hacker Rank python course](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains). You should also begin the Algorithms course and choose python as you
language to solve the problem. And if you are really bold, do the Data Structures course as well.
